        <li>I love playing video games since when i was a child. My best friend Emre and I have been friends for 15 years.
            One of the our favourite activity was playing video games. Ever since I could remember I have a computer. Except that
            I have VCD when I was 7 years old and I was playing super mario with my mother.</li> <br><br>
